# simple-etl
Create a simple ETL tool using python libraries

Created the basic folder structure

Using github updated the main.py to get cli arguments for type 'file' and 'database'.
For each type there can only be specific values that the user can send, for 'file' type he can only send a path of the file as connection_string and for the 'database' type he can only send the database connection_string as host, port, username, password, database_name. Both are tested manully and work correctly as of now.
